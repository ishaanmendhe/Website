In the quiet town of Reactville, developers live in harmony, crafting components and passing props with ease. But one day, a mystery unfolds that sends shockwaves through the community: props begin to disappear without a trace. This tale of intrigue and debugging will guide you through the dark alleys of React development to uncover the truth behind the disappearing props.

## Chapter 1: The Disappearance

Our story begins with a developer, much like yourself, who notices something amiss. A component that once displayed data proudly now stands empty, a shadow of its former self. The props, it seems, have vanished.

```jsx
const MysteryComponent = ({ clue }) => (
  <div>{clue ? `Clue: ${clue}` : "No clue found."}</div>
);
```

## Chapter 2: Gathering Clues

Determined to solve the mystery, our developer dons their detective hat and begins to gather clues. The first stop? The PropTypes alley, where the types of props are declared. Perhaps the culprit left a clue in the form of a type mismatch.

```jsx
import PropTypes from "prop-types";

MysteryComponent.propTypes = {
  clue: PropTypes.string,
};
```
